		<p class="intro-text">The Human Tracking Laser Turret is a security system that can detect the colors on people's clothes and sound an alarm if it recognizes that the people wearing those colors are intruders. A user can determine which colors sound the alarm by connecting the turret to a computer and downloading the PixyMon v2 software. Through this software, the turret can be trained to identify up to seven colors as unauthorized. The turret was pre-trained to recognize a reddish-pink color as unauthorized to showcase it working in action. </p>
		<p class="intro-text">The turret continuously pans back and forth to search for a target. When it detects someone wearing clothing of an unauthorized color it will:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Sound an alarm</li>
			<li>Shine three lasers on the person</li>
			<li>Track that person's movement</li>
			
		</ol>
		<p class="intro-text">The turret be used by companies as a security system to keep a room off limits to subordinates. This is espically useful for companies where the subordinates wear uniforms that are the same color, such as camp counselors.</p>

		<h2>Stages of Development</h2>

		<h3>Stage 1</h3>
		<img id="turret-s1" src="photos/turret_s1.jpg" alt="turret stage 1">
		<p id="s1">In the first stage, I made cuts to the pan/tilt base to make room for wiring, and attached the camera.</p>

		<h3>Stage 2</h3>
		<img id="turret-s2" src="photos/turret_s2.jpg" alt="turret stage 2">
		<p id="s2">This is an older version of the robot. The camera is glued onto the pan/tilt base, which is glued onto a rubik's cube. The lasers are all wired up!</p>

		<h3>Stage 3</h3>
		<video id="turret-s3" controls>
			<source src="photos/turret_s3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<p id="s3">After adjusting some parameters in PixyMon and testing some Arduino programs, I was able to get the turret to track me when I attach a reddish/pink marker to my shirt!</p>

		<h3 id="s4-heading">Stage 4</h3>
		<img id="turret-s4" src="photos/turret_s4.jpg" alt="turret stage 4">
		<p id="s4">I constructed a new base for turret by laser cutting parts and attaching a door so that the wiring can be adjusted if necessary. In addition, the turret runs indipendently from the computer and continually pans back and forth until it finds a target.</p>

		<h3>Stage 5</h3>
		<img id="turret-s5" src="photos/turret_s5.jpg" alt="turret stage 5">
		<p id="s6">I attached a speaker to the turret and programmed it so that it sounds an alarm when it identifies a target. I also programmed the turret so that it only shines its lasers when it finds a target. Finally, I added some decorative signs to scare intruders away.</p>

		<h3>Final Stage</h3>
		<video id="turret-s6" controls>
			<source src="photos/turret_s6.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<p id="s6">In the final stage, I trained the turret to recognize a reddish-pink shirt as unauthorized. As you can see, it does not react when someone with a blue shirt walks into the room. When some enters the room with a reddish-pink shirt it sounds the alarm, shines lasers on me, and pans to track me as I move through the room.</p>
